  <p>This is the Web interface for the WeatherDB. The WeatherDB is a Database that automatically downloads the weather station data from the DWD-CDC server, checks the data, creates completely filled timeseries and aplies a Richter correction to the precipitation data. On this Web interface you can download the raw, checked, filled and Richter corrected timeseries for your simulations.</p>
