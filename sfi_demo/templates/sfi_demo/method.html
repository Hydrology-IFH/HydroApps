          <p>{% trans "The core element of the AVOSS web demonstrator is the newly developed pluvial flood index (PFI). The PFI describes the risk posed by rapidly flowing surface water, which often runs off outside of rivers along small streams, depressions in the terrain, or paths and roads as a result of severe thunderstorms and can pose a danger to life and limb. The current warning system, which is based exclusively on precipitation amount and duration, does not provide reliable information about this hazard." %}</p>

          <p>{% trans "In order to identify the PFI, a modeling chain must be calculated—from precipitation data to hydrological runoff formation and hydraulic runoff accumulation to the identification of pluvial flood hazard areas (PFHA) and finally the classification of the PFI—as visualized in the figure below." %} </p>
          <p>{% trans "The criteria for identifying PFHA are as follows. All grid points with a maximum flood depth of ≥30 cm, a maximum flow velocity of &ge;1.5 m/s, or a maximum specific discharge of &ge;200 l/m*s are classified as potentially prone to pluvial flooding. The PFI is then classified based on the proportion of PFHA areas within a defined radius of each cell in the model area." %}</p>

This means that no outflowing flooding can occur above this size of the contributing catchment area. In the case of real heavy rainfall events, this limitation does not exist due to the spatial limitation of real heavy rainfall events." %}</p>

For this purpose, a large data set of maximum flood depths and maximum flow velocities was generated using 2D hydraulic models for a large number of different heavy rainfall events. This was then used, together with the OA values entered into the 2D modeling, to train multi-layer artificial neural networks, which in turn can identify detailed HRRMs in near real time for any OA inputs.
